This is a magical docker thing i made to compile ttygif into a docker image so i could use it to offload the work of making the gif without me having to keep it in the foreground.

this calls upon the magic of https://github.com/icholy/ttygif and some stuff from https://github.com/kfatehi/docker-chrome-xvfb
